# Vintage Story Block Interactions Demo

This mod shows which interaction events are fired when a block is right clicked.

## Building

The `VINTAGE_STORY` environment variable must be set before loading the
project. It should be set to the install location of Vintage Story (the
directory that contains VintagestoryLib.dll).

A Visual Studio Code workspace is included. The mod can be built through it or
from the command line.
